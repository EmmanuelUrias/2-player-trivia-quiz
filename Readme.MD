// I am going to make a quiz game where there are two players where they are each going to take turns answering questions.

// The trivia game will continue with pages including a question and four answers

// I am going to start with a very basic version of the quiz without questions or very specific id/classes but will fill those in later.

// I decided to make the base quiz first as if it was single player and then add the second player things later.

// I will be adding a feature that makes the background red or green depending if u got the question right or wrong which i think will look really cool.

// moved player-con outside of the hide class return it back once you've styled the container.

//fixing styling bugs, when in full screen all my containers are misaligned and look wonky.

//fixed the most annoying bug in my JS right now. there was a line of code in my nextQuestion function that was some how copied from my showQuestion function and would make the question undefined

//Make a function or functions that makes the trivia two player and gets the score

// start game function
make sure start button works and hides after being clicked. Also add the player score container.

also make sure the first question shows

// next question function
shows the next question in the array that is shuffled

//show question function
make the proper question show up and have the proper answers with the correct right answers show up

//reset question
removes the question and answers but also have to tie this function in with another function that adds the new question and removes the right or wrong background

// click answer
The buttons currently don't do anything and i have to make a function that selects the a button and the button actually has a connection to the answers in my array

// right or wrong function
need a function that reads whether an answer is right or wrong

// reset page
Want a function that resets the page before going into the next question

// scoreboard idea
make 2 variables and buttons one for each player. And count the score by making a counter but i wil have to make a new container having the directions on that display on the screen.

// Will continue to play with it and add features in the future.
