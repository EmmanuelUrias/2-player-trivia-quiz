// I am going to make a quiz game where there are two players where they are each going to take turns answering questions. the questions will be asked in levels and each question will hold a certain value depending on the difficulty. At the end the player with the most points wins.

// The trivia game will continue with pages including a question and four answers

// I am going to start with a very basic version of the quiz without questions or very specific id/classes but will fill those in later.
