// I am going to make a quiz game where there are two players where they are each going to take turns answering questions. the questions will be asked in levels and each question will hold a certain value depending on the difficulty. At the end the player with the most points wins.

// The trivia game will continue with pages including a question and four answers

// I am going to start with a very basic version of the quiz without questions or very specific id/classes but will fill those in later.

// I decided to make the base quiz first as if it was single player and then add the second player things later.

// I will be adding a feature that makes the background red or green depending if u got the question right or wrong which i think will look really cool.

// the second player feature will be added by adding labels to each question to let the users know who's turn it is and it will keep score by each question having a value and a board to keep score of who's winning.

// moved player-con outside of the hide class return it back once you've styled the container.
